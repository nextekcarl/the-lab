      I built this app to on a whim using the Faker gem to generate random superpowers.
      I've made some adjustments and changes since then to act as a framework to generate
      all kinds of random superbeings. You can decide whether they would be a hero or
      villian. The Faker Gem is used less now, as I've built a system to generate powers
      and weaknesses that work the way I wanted them to work.

      The scale selected for everything is based upon the IQ scale. For the stats, a 105
      is about human average. A 140 IQ is a genius, so use that a a metaphorical guide for
      the other stats. A 140 Strength would be an olympic power lifter. A 70 Health
      would be a frail person, perhaps sickly or a compromised immune system. Really high
      stats, especially possible for Aliens, migth blur the lines between the mundane and
      actual powers.

      Each origin uses different combinations of random generation to create the powers
      and stats, weaknesses (if any), and there may be a few special modifiers that
      show up from time to time. ;) This is still a work in progress, and new origins and
      concepts might show up at any time.

      Powers follow a similar system, but a 105 would be an average superhero or villain
      with that power, since normal people don't have any powers. So if your alien has super
      strength 105, you'd assume they are very strong, like Spiderman or Luke Cage, which
      would probably be equal to a 200 normal Strength score, roughly. But Super Stat: Strength
      at 50 would be stronger than a very strong norml person.

      Warning! You shouldn't be surprised to find completely absurd combinations. You might
      get someone who is both weak vs death touch and immune to death touch. The app is not
      advanced enough to account for that, and never will be. The names used will be less
      than original in most cases, but they give you something to call them, which will be
      important eventually.

      The next thing I want to add is a series of random battles. Arenas will be generated, along
      with two Superbeings. They will be pitted against each other in a fight to decide who wins.
      The visitors will vote for the one they think would win, and after voting closes, the one with
      the most votes wins. I haven't built the voting system yet. I'm still working out how I want
      that to actually work. I'd like to automate it, and not require login, but that makes gaming
      the system easier and more likely.
