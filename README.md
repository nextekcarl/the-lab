TODO:
Add an Arena route. Each one will have 2 superbeings facing off and an environment.

People will vote for who they think will win. Maybe they can leave comments about why?

After a set amount of time, the one with the most votes wins. Then they face someone
new in a different arena. Rinse, repeat.

I'll need a Environment model (Arena?) of some sort. Something to associate 2 superbeings, and collect
and tally votes.
